Inline CSS
----------
- Inline CSS is a method of applying CSS styles directly to HTML elements using the style 
  attribute within the opening tag of the element. 
- This approach is useful for applying unique styles to individual elements quickly, but 
  it is generally not recommended for larger projects due to its lack of reusability and 
  separation of concerns.
  
- Example:
    <h1 style="color: blue; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This is a Heading</h1>
