External CSS
------------
- External CSS is a method of applying CSS styles to a web page by linking to a separate CSS file. 
- This file contains all the style rules and is linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag 
  within the <head> section. External CSS is a best practice for larger websites and projects because 
- it promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and easier maintenance.

- Example:
    /* styles.css */
    body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
        color: blue;
    }
    p {
        color: green;
    }
