Simple Selectors
----------------
- Simple selectors are the basic building blocks of CSS selectors. 
- They are used to target and apply styles to HTML elements based on their type, class, 
  id, or attributes.
- There are 5 types of simple selectors:
    1> Element Selector
    2> ID Selector
    3> Class Selector
    4> Universal Selector
    5> Group Selector

1> Element Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Element Selector (also known as a type selector) is a CSS selector that targets all HTML 
  elements of a given type. 
- It applies the specified styles to every instance of that element within the document.
- Example:
    p {
        color: blue;
    }

2> ID Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ID Selector is a CSS selector that targets a single HTML element based on its unique 'id' 
  attribute. 
- It applies the specified styles to that specific element and is denoted by a hash (#).
- Example:
    #myId {
        color: red;
    }

3> Class Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Class Selector is a CSS selector that targets all HTML elements with a specific class attribute. 
- It applies the specified styles to every element that has the specified class and is denoted by 
  a dot (.).
- Example:
    .myClass {
        color: green;
    }

4. Universal Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Universal Selector is a CSS selector that targets all HTML elements on a web page. 
- It applies the specified styles to every element and is denoted by an asterisk (*).
- Example:
    * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }

5. Group Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Group Selector is a CSS selector that allows you to apply the same styles to multiple elements. 
- It groups several selectors together, separated by commas, and applies the specified styles to all 
  of the grouped elements.
- Example:
    h1, h2, h3 {
        color: blue;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
